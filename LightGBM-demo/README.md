# LightGBM Model Training, Deployment, and Amazon SageMaker AI Features

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow using Amazon SageMaker, focusing on the following key steps:

1. Environment Setup: Importing necessary libraries and setting up the SageMaker session.
2. Data Preparation: Generating synthetic data for a regression problem.
3. Model Training: Training a LightGBM model using SageMaker's built-in algorithm.
4. Model Deployment: Deploying the trained model to a SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference.
5. Inference Simulation: Simulating thousands of inference requests to the deployed endpoint.
6. SageMaker Features:
   - Training a second model with different hyperparameters.
   - Conducting a shadow test to compare the performance of two model versions.
   - Implementing a canary deployment to gradually shift traffic to the new model version.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with SageMaker access
- Python 3.7+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter notebook.
2. Open the notebook in SageMaker Studio or a SageMaker notebook instance.
3. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create SageMaker resources.

## Usage

Run through the notebook cells sequentially. Each section is documented with markdown cells explaining the purpose and functionality of the code.

## Key Features

- Synthetic data generation for regression problems
- LightGBM model training with SageMaker
- Real-time inference endpoint deployment
- Large-scale inference request simulation
- Shadow testing for model comparison
- Canary deployment for gradual model updates

## Cleanup

Remember to delete the SageMaker endpoint and other resources created during the notebook execution to avoid unnecessary costs.
